#A Check-In/Attendance Tracker WebApp for a club or group using a mySQL database

Out of the need for a check-in program, this program was created to maintain a database of members and their attendence to club meetings. This program is written in python and utilizes a flask framework for the web application. A live version of the webapp can be found at http://checkin.dot-slash-cs.club.
